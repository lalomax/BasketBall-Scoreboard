## About The Project

<img width="819" height="522" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aaa2ea58-e8bd-4743-973c-9b76e4678ef9" />



The code [(scrimba project)](https://v2.scrimba.com/home) provides basic functionality for managing and displaying scores within a web application.

### Purpose:
The provided JavaScript code is designed to manipulate and display numerical values within HTML elements. It specifically focuses on updating and resetting scores, likely in a context like a game or scorekeeping application.

### Functionality:

* Identifies HTML elements: The code selects two HTML elements with the IDs "home-result" and "guest-result" and stores references to them in variables markerHome and markerGuest, respectively. These elements probably display the scores for two teams or players.
Defines functions:
* put(e): This function is used to increment a score. It takes an event object e as input, which presumably contains information about which team's score should be updated and the value to add. The function retrieves the current score from the appropriate HTML element, converts it to a number, adds the new value, and then updates the HTML element with the new score.
* make(e): This function is used to reset a score to zero. Similar to put, it takes an event object e and determines which score to reset based on the event information. It then sets the corresponding HTML element's content to "0".




### Built With

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
